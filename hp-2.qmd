### Boundary file

A regional boundary file is downloaded as part of the data pre-processing step and is contained in the object `sa_bound`.

This can be plotted as a static or interactive map:

```{r}
#| label: fig-basic-map
#| fig-cap: "KSA boundary map"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|     - "static"
#|     - "interactive"

sa_bound |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf()

mapview(sa_bound)

```
